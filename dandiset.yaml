description: We recorded spikes from the ALM and thalamus during tactile discrimination  with
  a delayed directional response. Here we show that, similar to ALM  neurons, thalamic
  neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity  that predicted movement direction.
  Unilateral photoinhibition of delay  activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional
  neglect.  Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete  collapse
  of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished  thalamic activity.
  Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in  motor preparation and suggest
  that persistent activity requires reciprocal  excitation across multiple brain areas.
